Separate QLS in its own project to avoid accidental dependencies of QL on QLS (if you're doing QLS).

This dependency is the wrong way round:
 IExpressionVisitor<T> extends IVisitor

IVisitor should be composed of IExpressionVisitor/IStatementVisitor etc. Now you're not adding anything, and still inheriting the statement and form stuff. Same of IStatementVisitor

Why is this in ANode?
public void printSelf() {

    }

//This is still questionable
In QuestionPage: why have the types themselves decide how to render themselves?
 switch (question.getType()){}

I have trouble understanding the package com.klq.logic.question
It seems it's wrapping AST stuff, but what is the added value? There's no JavaFx widgets either.
Is this an unneeded level of indirection.
=====> The added value is making the hierarchy flatter. E.g., a question with a condition that has another condition above doesn't know about the upper condition.)

Typo: typecheker.

Why is the questionType a String? Can't you just create Type objects in the ANTLR visitor/listener?
 String questionType,
 
This constructor should call the other one: the initialization logic is now duplicated.
  public Location(ParserRuleContext context, String inputFile){
  
I like the design of the Store class, with one exception: the reference to the JavaFX stuff. Can you eliminate that dependency? The store should not have to know about the GUI.
=====> Only the progressProperty is from JFX anymore.

This is a library class. Can you move the methods to somewhere they make more sense?
public class InputValidator
=====> made a matchesInput() method in each Type of QuestionPane.

Isn't this too general? What is allowed as answers for answersets?
private List<AExpression> answers;
======> removed the Set type from language.

What does it mean for a ComputedQuestionNode to have a list of children? What do they represent?

Return List<ANode>
public ArrayList<ANode> getChildren() {


Use List here (in Conditional Node)
 ArrayList<ANode> children
Here there is the problem that now the children (?) can be anything, including Expression (because AExpression extends ANode).
Try to design the hierarchy such that the types ensure that you can only build valid trees.
Same problem with QuestionnaireNode

In QuestionMapper you see problem of not having a separate StatemenVisitor: lot of refused bequest (bogus methods on expression returning null).

Also mentioned before: the firstPass and secondPass things *could* be used incorrectly: encode the dependency explicitly by letting the result of one pass be input to the second pass.

Tangling in QuestionTable: it should do one thing (maintaining relation between name and question object), but it also checks for undefined names. This can be easily moved elsewhere. Also: again use List<> at declaration sites.

This is not so good: you use the accidental AST class types to check for QL types. Even though this could work, now it doesn't, since the BooleanNode is not an instance of ABooleanNode.
 if(node.getCondition() instanceof ABooleanNode) {
You can refactor by allowing you to ask an expression what is its type (possibly given certain argument types).
In this particular case, you should check what is returned from: node.getCondition().accept(this);

In Type visitBinaryNode(ABinaryExprNode node, String operator, List<Type> allowedTypes){
the case that null is returned is missed. Although you get away with it, it's a very fine line. ===> add undefined type and return this
======================================================================================================================================================================================================
EVERYTHING ABOVE THIS LINE IS FIXED
======================================================================================================================================================================================================

Identifiers are not literals, so they in the wrong package.
And they are also not values: public class IdentifierValue extends Value<String> {
(They are *bound* to values in the environment (e.g. Map<String,Value>). ===> Replace identifiervalue with identifiernode

In Main this field is never initialize (Main is not instantiated, it seems):
 private Questionnaire questionnaire;

These expression depend on singletonness of types: childType != node.getQuestionType() ====> is okay because we use enum???

Avoid extending stdlib base classes (like JavaFX): you're not extending the framework, and probably you don't support the full contract of the base class. Better to encapsulate instead of extend.
